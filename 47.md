BIP-47 payment code notification via Nostr DM
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:kdmukai`

For new or existing BIP-47 payment codes (and/or PayNyms), any user can derive the payment code's associated Nostr `npub1` pubkey. That opens up the possibility to DM the payer's notification to the recipient that is normally done as an onchain `OP_RETURN` in BIP-47.

The onchain "pollution" of using `OP_RETURN` is a legit criticism of BIP-47. This would eliminate that problem while still being completely deterministic (as long as the recipient still has the private key that's associated with their BIP-47 payment code, they'd always be able to regain access to their Nostr DMs sent to their payment code's `npub` pubkey).
