BIP-47 payment code notification via Nostr DM
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:kdmukai`

For new or existing BIP-47 payment codes (and/or PayNyms), any user can derive the payment code's associated Nostr `npub1` pubkey. That opens up the possibility to DM the payer's notification to the recipient that is normally done as an onchain `OP_RETURN` in BIP-47.

The onchain "pollution" of using `OP_RETURN` is a legit criticism of BIP-47. This would eliminate that problem while still being completely deterministic (as long as the recipient still has the private key that's associated with their BIP-47 payment code, they'd always be able to regain access to their Nostr DMs sent to their payment code's `npub` pubkey).


## Overview
### Alice notifies Bob
Per usual BIP-47 usage, Alice and Bob have generated their respective payment codes. Bob has published his payment code for anyone to use to send him BIP-47 payments.

Alice wants to notify Bob that she will begin sending him BIP-47 payments.

Alice derives the corresponding NIP-47 `npub` from Bob's BIP-47 public payment code.

Alice can now DM her BIP-47 payment code to Bob's NIP-47 pubkey. This replaces the BIP-47 onchain notification tx. Alice does not need to blind her payment code since the content of her DM to Bob won't be publicly exposed.

However, in order to preserve her privacy and not reveal that she is interacting with Bob's NIP-47 pubkey, Alice can use a "burner" Nostr private key to DM the one-time notification to Bob.

### Bob checks his NIP-47 DM notifications
Similar to how Alice can derive Bob's NIP-47 pubkey from his BIP-47 payment code, Bob can derive the private key associated with his NIP-47 pubkey.

With the associated NIP-47 private key, he can see his NIP-47 notification DMs. For convenience, Bob's NIP-47 private key can [delegate (NIP-26)](26.md) DM access to Bob's normal Nostr key so he can access his NIP-47 notification DMs without having to juggle keys.


## Example
Test vectors from [BIP-47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki):
```
ALICE_MNEMONIC = "response seminar brave tip suit recall often sound stick owner lottery motion"
ALICE_PAYMENT_CODE = "PM8TJTLJbPRGxSbc8EJi42Wrr6QbNSaSSVJ5Y3E4pbCYiTHUskHg13935Ubb7q8tx9GVbh2UuRnBc3WSyJHhUrw8KhprKnn9eDznYGieTzFcwQRya4GA"

BOB_MNEMONIC = "reward upper indicate eight swift arch injury crystal super wrestle already dentist"
BOB_PAYMENT_CODE = "PM8TJS2JxQ5ztXUpBBRnpTbcUXbUHy2T1abfrb3KkAAtMEGNbey4oumH7Hc578WgQJhPjBxteQ5GHHToTYHE3A1w6p7tU6KSoFmWBVbFGjKPisZDbP97"
BOB_NOSTR_PUBKEY = 'npub1fn5w8vzw5gzl7j049x2sv9krmds4k83hw5u93nrqc88xf5t79tvqmnnus7'

## Python implementation
_Note: Move this to a separate gist?_
```
$ pip install embit nostr
```

### Alice derives Bob's NIP-47 pubkey from his BIP-47 payment code
```python
import nostr
from binascii import 
from embit import base58, ec
from embit.bip32 import HDKey

# Decode Bob's base58 payment code and verify the checksum
raw_payment_code = base58.decode_check(BOB_PAYMENT_CODE)

# Parse the 81-byte payment code format:
#   0x47 0x01 0x00 (sign) (32-byte pubkey) (32-byte chain code) (13 0x00 bytes)
pubkey = ec.PublicKey.from_string(hexlify(raw_payment_code[3:36]))
chain_code = raw_payment_code[36:68]

# Derive the 0th pubkey (normally used to generate the BIP-47 notification addr)
key = HDKey(key=pubkey, chain_code=chain_code)
zeroth_bip47_pubkey = key.derive([0])

# Convert it to a Nostr npub:
nostr.PublicKey(zeroth_bip47_pubkey.xonly()).bech32()
>> 'npub1fn5w8vzw5gzl7j049x2sv9krmds4k83hw5u93nrqc88xf5t79tvqmnnus7'
```
